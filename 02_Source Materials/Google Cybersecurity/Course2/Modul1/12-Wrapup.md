### **Review of the First Section**

In the first section of the course, we covered several important topics that form the foundation of a career in cybersecurity:

1. **CISSP Security Domains**:

   - We began by exploring the eight security domains that CISSP focuses on. These domains provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of cybersecurity.

2. **Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**:

   - We discussed the impact of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities on organizations. Key concepts included the understanding of ransomware and how it works, as well as an introduction to the **three layers of the web** (Surface Web, Deep Web, Dark Web).

3. **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**:
   - We focused on the **seven steps** of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) which are essential for managing risks within an organization:
     - **Prepare**
     - **Categorize**
     - **Select**
     - **Implement**
     - **Assess**
     - **Authorize**
     - **Monitor**

### **Next Steps**

In the upcoming sections, you’ll dive deeper into the tools used by entry-level security analysts, including how to:

- Analyze data generated by security tools to identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities.
- Use a playbook to effectively respond to incidents.

### **Final Thought**

You’ve made great progress in enhancing your cybersecurity knowledge, and you’re well on your way to becoming proficient in managing security risks and threats. Keep up the great work!
